***This is my first full stack project***
###
Workflow:-
1.) First a Login page opens
2.) Authorized user gets in
3.) User sees the option to add Username, Password and Website name
4.) If the user already has some passwords there, there are options to delete and update
5.) Lastly, the user has the option to Logout
